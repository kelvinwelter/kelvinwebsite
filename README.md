## ðŸŒŒ Kelvin's Website
This is the repository of my personal website. My site was created to host my essays, posts, projects, biography and so on... Everything I share on the internet is aggregated on my site. All my contact links are also available there.

## ðŸ›  Technologies
This [React](https://reactjs.org/) project was created using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a very nice frontend framework that made me develop this site faster and easier. The UI of this website was built using [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), a simple component library that gave me access to beatiful UI elements that I used throughot the site.
