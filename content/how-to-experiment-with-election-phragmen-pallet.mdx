preview: "Learn how to work with a governance pallet, used in Polkadot itself, called Elections Phragmen. We will build a blockchain that has elections built into the network itself. After this tutorial, you will have a network where you can submit applications and vote for example."

Lately, I have become increasingly interested in blockchain and the possibilities this concept can make a reality.
For this reason, I have been studying more and more about the subject. 
During my studies, I found the Figment Learn platform, a fantastic website that provides several free tutorials on the most diverse protocols.

Since I found Figment Learn, I have taken numerous tutorials and pathways. 
All this content has helped me a lot during my learning. 
So, I decided to give back to the platform and the community by writing a tutorial about my favorite protocol within the world of blockchains: Polkadot.

The tutorial I wrote is relatively simple, as I am still learning a LOT about the subject, but it touches on a very interesting issue: elections within the protocol.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to install and configure the pallets needed to work with elections inside a blockchain.
In addition, you will also learn how to interact with these pallets on the front-end, creating components to vote and run for election in a simplified way.

To conclude, the tutorial has been published on the Figment Learn platform, [you can access it through this link](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/how-to-experiment-with-election-phragmen-pallet)

I hope you enjoy the tutorial and learn something new from it! Please feel free to contact me by email if you have any questions or difficulties during the tutorial. That's all for today, see you later!
