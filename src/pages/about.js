          Hello, I'm Kelvin! I help build fast, elegant, and innovative software. 
          I have been working for over 3 years developing Javascript-based software (Node.js, React.js, and React Native). 
          Furthermore, I recently completed my bachelor's degree in computer science at the State University of Santa Catarina.

          I was born and raised in Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, but I have already had experiences working remotely with American companies ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. 
          Until now, all my work experience has been based in startups. 
          I love the environment and culture of startups, the pace of work, the feeling of creation and innovation that I feel in these companies. 
          All this motivates me to keep working in this kind of environment, collaborating and innovating to always achieve the best possible result.

          I live life knowing that our time is limited and wanting to make the most of it.
          I enjoy life learning every day more about software engineering, blockchains, management, cryptocurrencies, business, and so on.
          Even following this confusing and chaotic line on various topics, I am always learning and studying.

          Besides living my life trying to gather as much knowledge as possible, I live a life full of hobbies. 
          My main hobby is tourism, I love to travel. 
          The feeling of getting to know new places, exploring the unknown, and discovering as much of our planet as possible is priceless to me. 
          Currently, the best trip of my life was to Porto de Galinhas, let's see what the future holds.

          Other than traveling, I love to read books, ride my bike, work out, play video games, and watch movies. 
          Not necessarily in this order.

          Well, I guess that's a good summary of who I am.
          Finally, I would like to mention my challenge with myself.
          In the last few months, I've heard about the #LearnInPublic concept, it's about the habit of creating and publishing content about what I'm currently learning.
          With that in mind, I challenged myself to build this habit. 
          I believe it is a positive attitude, both for the community and for me. 
          So this website will be used for publishing content about what I am learning at the moment. 
          I very much hope that I will succeed in building this habit. 
          It is time to get out of "learn in private"!
